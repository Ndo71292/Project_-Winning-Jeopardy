    "\n",
    "The mean value of the \"question_overlap\" column in the Jeopardy dataset provides insights into the degree of question recycling over time. This column measures the proportion of words in a question that have been used before in previous questions. A higher mean value suggests a higher likelihood of question recycling, while a lower mean value indicates less repetition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the calculated mean of the \"question_overlap\" column, we can make a few observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. High Question Overlap: If the mean is relatively high, it implies that there is a substantial degree of question recycling occurring over time. This means that previous questions have been reused, and familiarity with past questions could potentially give an advantage in preparing for future games.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Low Question Overlap: Conversely, if the mean is low, it suggests that there is minimal repetition of questions. This indicates a greater emphasis on creating new and unique questions, making it less likely that studying past questions alone will significantly enhance performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the mean of the \"question_overlap\" column provides a general overview and doesn't provide insights into specific question categories or time periods. It's possible that certain categories or time periods may exhibit higher or lower question overlap than the overall mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare effectively for Jeopardy, considering the question overlap can help inform your studying strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High overlap: Focus on reviewing and studying previous Jeopardy questions to identify common themes, topics, and recurring patterns. Familiarity with past questions can improve your chances of answering correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Low overlap: Emphasize broadening your knowledge base, exploring diverse subject areas, and understanding underlying concepts rather than relying heavily on memorizing specific questions and answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that studying strategies should be well-rounded, combining category exploration, general knowledge enhancement, and regular practice with buzzer timing to succeed in the dynamic and diverse world of Jeopardy.\n"

A smaller p-value suggests stronger evidence against the null hypothesis of no association.\n",
